	\tsec{Ode to the West Wind (partial)}
		\subsec{I}
			\tp{1.}
				O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn’s being,
				Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
				Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,
			\tp{2.}
				Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
				Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,
				Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed
			\tp{3.}
				The wingèd seeds, where they lie cold and low,
				Each like a corpse within its grave, until
				Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow
			\tp{4.}
				Her clarion o’er the dreaming earth, and fill
				(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)
				With living hues and odours plain and hill:
			\tp{5.}
				Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;
				Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O hear!
		\subsec{II}
			\tp{1.}
				Thou on whose stream, ‘mid the steep sky’s commotion,
				Loose clouds like Earth’s decaying leaves are shed,
				Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,
			\tp{2.}
				Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread
				On the blue surface of thine airy surge,
				Like the bright hair uplifted from the head
			\tp{3.}
				Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge
				Of the horizon to the zenith’s height,
				The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge
			\tp{4.}
				Of the dying year, to which this closing night
				Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre
				Vaulted with all thy congregated might
			\tp{5.}
				Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere
				Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: O hear!
