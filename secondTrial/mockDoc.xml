        <title>Ode to the West Wind (partial)</title>
			<subsection><tag>2.1</tag><title>I</title>
				<paragraph><tag>1.</tag>
						<p>O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumns being, <break/>Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead <break/>Are driven, like ghosts from an enchante fleeing,</p>
     		    </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph><tag>2.</tag>
						<p>Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,<break/>Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou, <break/>Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed</p>
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph><tag>3.</tag>
						<p>The wingÃ¨d seeds, where they lie cold and low,<break/>Each like a corpse within its grave, until <break/>Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow</p>
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph><tag>4.</tag>
						<p>Her clarion oâer the dreaming earth, and fill <break/>(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air) <break/>With living hues and odours plain and hill:</p>
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph><tag>5.</tag>
						<p>Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere; <break/>Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O hear!</p>

						<p>Thou on whose stream, âmid the steep skyâs commotion, <break/>Loose clouds like Earthâs decaying leaves are shed, <break/>Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,</p>
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph><tag>2.</tag>
						<p>Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread <break/>On the blue surface of thine airy surge, <break/>Like the bright hair uplifted from the head</p>
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph><tag>3.</tag>
						<p>Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge <break/>Of the horizon to the zenithâs height, <break/>The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dir</p>
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph><tag>4.</tag>
						<p>Of the dying year, to which this closing night <break/>Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre <break/>Vaulted with all thy congregated might</p>
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph><tag>5.</tag>
						<p>Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere <break/>Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: O hear!</p>
