	<paragraph>
						<p>O wild West Wind,
						thou breath of Autumns
						being, <break/>Thou,
						from whose unseen
						presence the leaves
						dead <break/>Are
						driven, like ghosts
						from an enchante
						fleeing,</p>
						
        </paragraph>
     	<paragraph>
						<p>Yellow, and black,
						and pale, and hectic
						red,<break/>Pestilence-stricken
						multitudes: O thou,
						<break/>Who chariotest
						to their dark wintry
						bed</p>
						
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph>
						<p>The wingd seeds,
						where they lie cold
						and low,<break/>Each
						like a corpse within
						its grave, until
						<break/>Thine azure
						sister of the Spring
						shall blow</p>
						
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph>
						<p>Her clarion oer the
						dreaming earth, and
						fill <break/>(Driving
						sweet buds like flocks
						to feed in air)
						<break/>With living
						hues and odours plain
						and hill:</p>
						
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph>
						<p>Wild Spirit, which
						art moving everywhere;
						<break/>Destroyer and
						Preserver; hear, O
						hear!</p>
						
     			 </paragraph>

			<subsection><title>II</title>
			<paragraph>
						<p>Thou on whose
						stream, mid the steep
						skys commotion,
						<break/>Loose clouds
						like Earths decaying
						leaves are shed,
						<break/>Shook from the
						tangled boughs of
						Heaven and Ocean,</p>
						
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph>
						<p>Angels of rain and
						lightning: there are
						spread <break/>On the
						blue surface of thine
						airy surge,
						<break/>Like the
						bright hair uplifted
						from the head</p>
						
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph>
						<p>Of some fierce
						Maenad, even from the
						dim verge <break/>Of
						the horizon to the
						zeniths height,
						<break/>The locks of
						the approaching
						storm. Thou dir</p>
						
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph>
						<p>Of the dying year,
						to which this closing
						night <break/>Will be
						the dome of a vast
						sepulchre
						<break/>Vaulted with
						all thy congregated
						might</p>
						
     			 </paragraph>
     			 <paragraph>
						<p>Of vapours, from
						whose solid atmosphere
						<break/>Black rain,
						and fire, and hail
						will burst: O
						hear!</p>
