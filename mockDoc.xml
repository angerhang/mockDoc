    <p>Ode to the West Wind (partial)
<ERROR class="undefined">\thesection</ERROR>.I

O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumnâs being,
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,

Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed

The wingÃ¨d seeds, where they lie cold and low,
Each like a corpse within its grave, until
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow

Her clarion oâer the dreaming earth, and fill
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)
With living hues and odours plain and hill:

<!-- %**** mockDoc.tex Line 25 **** -->Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;
Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O hear!
<ERROR class="undefined">\thesection</ERROR>.II

Thou on whose stream, âmid the steep skyâs commotion,
Loose clouds like Earthâs decaying leaves are shed,
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,

Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread
On the blue surface of thine airy surge,
Like the bright hair uplifted from the head

Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge
Of the horizon to the zenithâs height,
The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge

Of the dying year, to which this closing night
Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre
Vaulted with all thy congregated might

Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere
Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: O hear!</p>
