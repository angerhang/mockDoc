	\section{A brief introduction about Shelley}
		Percy Bysshe Shelley (4 August 1792 -- 8 July 1822) was one of the major English Romantic poets, and is regarded by some critics as amongst the finest lyric poets in the English language. 
	\section{Ode to the West Wind (partial)}
		\subsection{I}
			\paragraph{1.}
				O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being, \newline 
				Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead \newline 
				Are driven, like ghosts from an enchante fleeing,
			\paragraph{2.}
				Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,\newline 
				Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou, \newline	
				Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed
			\paragraph{3.}
				The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,\newline	
				Each like a corpse within its grave, until \newline
				Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow
			\paragraph{4.}
				Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill \newline (Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air) \newline With living hues and odours plain and hill:
			\paragraph{5.}
				Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere; \newline Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O hear!
		\subsection{II}
			\paragraph{1.}
				Thou on whose stream, 'mid the steep sky's commotion, \newline
				Loose clouds like Earth's decaying leaves are shed, \newline
				Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,
			\paragraph{2.}
				Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread \newline
				On the blue surface of thine airy surge, \newline
				Like the bright hair uplifted from the head
			\paragraph{3.}
				Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge \newline
				Of the horizon to the zenith's height, \newline
				The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge
			\paragraph{4.}
				Of the dying year, to which this closing night \newline
				Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre \newline
				Vaulted with all thy congregated might
			\paragraph{5.}
				Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere \newline
				Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: O hear!
