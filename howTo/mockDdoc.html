<h1>Ode to the West Wind (partial)</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>I</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p>
O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn&rsquo;s being, Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead Are driven, like ghosts from an enchante fleeing,
</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p>
Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou, Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed
</p>
<h3>3.</h3>
<p>
The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,Each like a corpse within its grave, until Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow
</p>
<h3>4.</h3>
<p>
Her clarion o&rsquo;er the dreaming earth, and fill (Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air) With living hues and odours plain and hill:
</p>
<h3>5.</h3>
<p>
Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere; Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O hear!
</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p>Thou on whose stream, &rsquo;mid the steep sky&rsquo;s commotion, Loose clouds like Earth&rsquo;s decaying leaves are shed, Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,
</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p>
Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread On the blue surface of thine airy surge, Like the bright hair uplifted from the head
</p>
<h3>3.</h3>
<p>
Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge Of the horizon to the zenith&rsquo;s height, The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge
</p>
<h3>4.</h3>
<p>
Of the dying year, to which this closing night Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre Vaulted with all thy congregated might
</p>
<h3>5.</h3>
<p>
Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: O hear!
